    <p>A category $C$ is defined as follows: One announces some
        constituents (A. objects, B. morphisms, C. identities, D. compositions) and shows that they conform to some laws (1. identity law, 2. associativity law). Specifically, one announces
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item a collection $Ob(C)$, elements of which are called objects.
            \item for every pair $x, y \in Ob(C)$, a set $Hom_C(x,y) \in Set$; it is called the hom-set from x to y; its elements are called morphisms from x to y.
            \item for every object $x \in Ob(C)$, a specified morphism, denoted $id_x \in HomC(x,x)$, and called the identity morphism on x;
            \item for every three objects $x,y,z \in Ob(C)$, a function $\circ: Hom_C(y,z) \times Hom_C(x,y) \rightarrow Hom_C(x,z)$, called the composition formula.
        \end{enumerate}
        Look at the unfinished diagram below. Some of the properties are missing! Fill out the rest of it in red. \\
